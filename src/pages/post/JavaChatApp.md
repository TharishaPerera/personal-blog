In this article we will implement a console based client/server chat application using Java sockets. This tutorial is about the backend implementation of this chat application using threads and encryption and decryption. I will explain the concepts and implemention step by step

**. &nbsp;** **. &nbsp; .**

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Create a java project and create create two java classes, `'Server.java'` & `'Client.java'`.
<pre>

`Server.java`
![server.java](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/2.png)

`Client.java`
![client.java](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/3.png)

<pre>
</pre>
**. &nbsp;** **. &nbsp; .**

**1-Step:** **Server.java**

First, let's declare 5 objects.
  
  1. 1 . ServerSocket ServerSocket
  2. 2 . Socket clientSocket
  3. 3 . BufferReader in
  4. 4 . PrintWriter out

![object declaration](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/4.png)

Now, let's instanciate the serverSocket object. The ServerSocket constructor requires the port number that the server will use to listen to clients' requests. The instanciation should be done inside a try catch block.

![serverSocket](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/5.png)

As the serverSocket is used by the server to listen to connection requests from clients, it uses the method `accept()` to wait for the request and once it received it and create an instance of `Socket` class which in our case will be the `clientSocket` object.

![clientSocket](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/6.png)

To instanciate `out`, we use the constructor of `PrintWriter` class, this constructor takes the output stream for the socket as a parameter, because it is responsible for sending data to client.

![PrintWriter](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/7.png)

`Sender thread` : This thread contains the code the server will use to send messages to client.
`Receiver thread` : This thread contains the code the server will use to receive messages from client.

`Sender Thread`
 ![SenderThread](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/8.png)

 `Receiver Thread`
 ![ReceiverThread](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/9.png)

 Now the Server is ready to communicate with Client.

 You can get the full code for `Server.java` file **[here](../../../public/files/javaChatApp/Server.java)**

</pre>
**. &nbsp;** **. &nbsp; .**

**2-Step:** **Client.java**

You will see, the most of the codes are as same as the `Server.java`.
![client.java](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/10.png)

Now, the `Client.java` also has two threads, one for sending data and the other for recieving data, they are implemented the same way as the `Server.java`'s threads.

`Sender Thread`
 ![SenderThread](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/11.png)

 `Receiver Thread`
 ![ReceiverThread](../../../public/images/postImages/javaChatApp/12.png)

 Now the Client is also ready to communicate with Server.

 You can get the full code for `Client.java` file **[here](../../../public/files/javaChatApp/Client.java)**
 
**. &nbsp;** **. &nbsp; .**

**EXECUTION**

Nopw letâ€™s see how this works.

First run the `Server.java` class then `Client.java` class.

**`Happy coding!`**
